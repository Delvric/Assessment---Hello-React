# Assessment: Simple Todo Application

For this assessment, we'd like you to extend the basic scaffold generated by
`create-react-app` with a few trivial features. In doing so, you'll be
demonstrating a basic understanding of the following:
    - kick-starting a React app using `create-react-app`
    - [props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
    - [state](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html)
    - [handling events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

## Getting Started

To get started, _fork_ this repository into your own GitHub account then clone
this repository to your local machine:

```console
foo@bar:~ $ git clone git@github.com:github-username/hello-world
foo@bar:~ $ cd hello-world
foo@bar:~/hello-world $
```

Note `github-username` above. In other words, *don't* simply copy-paste the
code above blindly into a terminal. 

You'll undoubtedly notice that the only thing in this repository is this
`README.md` file: that's intentional. In addition to getting you some extra
practice `forking` from existing code rather than initializing new git
repositories, we wanted to get you comfortable with relying on gathering
necessary information from project `README.md` files, as it's common practice in
the development world, especially as far as [open
source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) projects are
concerned.

## Acceptance Criteria
_Note: Please see the rubric on Canvas for detailed breeak down on how this
assessment is being graded. The information below is provided for your
convenience._

### Step 1: Basic React Scaffold (4 points)

Assuming you've properly installed `yarn`, all that is required to get these
points is to initialize a react application in your new repository. The tricky
part is that we want the root of the new React project to be the root of _this_
repository. That is, rather than a directory structure that looks like this:

We'd like you to generate a structure that looks like this:

You can accomplish that by invoking `create-react-app` as follows:

If your submission does not follow the above structure, but nevertheless
functions, you'll receive partial credit. Not paying attention to detail will
cost you ;-)!
