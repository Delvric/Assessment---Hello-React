# Assessment: Hello React

For this assessment, we'd like you to extend the basic scaffold generated by
`create-react-app` with a few trivial features. In doing so, you'll be
demonstrating a basic understanding of the following:
    - kick-starting a React app using `create-react-app`
    - [props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
    - [state](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html)
    - [handling events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

## Getting Started

To get started, _fork_ this repository into your own GitHub account then clone
this repository to your local machine:

```console
foo@bar:~ $ git clone git@github.com:github-username/hello-react
foo@bar:~ $ cd hello-react
foo@bar:~/hello-react $
```

Note `github-username` above. In other words, *don't* simply copy-paste the
code above blindly into a terminal. 

You'll undoubtedly notice that the only thing in this repository is this
`README.md` file and a `screenshots` directory: that's intentional. In addition
to getting you some extra practice `forking` from existing code rather than
initializing new git repositories, we wanted to get you comfortable with
relying on gathering necessary information from project `README.md` files, as
it's common practice in the development world, especially as far as [open
source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) projects are
concerned.

## Acceptance Criteria
_Note: Please see the rubric on Canvas for detailed breeak down on how this
assessment is being graded. The information below is provided for your
convenience._

### Step 1: Basic React Scaffold (4 points)

Assuming you've properly installed `yarn`, all that is required to get these
points is to initialize a react application in your new repository. The tricky
part is that we want the root of the new React project to be the root of _this_
repository. That is, rather than a directory structure that looks like this:

![incorrect project structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenzieAcademy/hello-react/master/screenshots/incorrect_layout.png)

We'd like you to generate a structure that looks like this:

![correct project structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenzieAcademy/hello-react/master/screenshots/correct_layout.png)

You can accomplish that by invoking `create-react-app` as follows:

```console
foo@bar:~/hello-react $ create-react-app .
```

Note that this `README.md` file will be renamed `README.old.md`, as
`create-react-app` generates its own `README.md` file, which is a
`create-react-app` user guide. We encourage you to take a look at it in your
free time, as it's jam-packed with all kinds of useful information

If your submission does not follow the above structure, but nevertheless
functions, you'll receive partial credit. Not paying attention to detail will
cost you ;-)!

### Step 2: Create a `Text` Component (4 points)

For this step, you will be defining a `Text` component just above the
`App` component in  `App.js`. We typically like to define components in separate
files and
[import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
them for use in more complex components. However, doing so would require an
understanding of [ES6
modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/), which is out
of scope for this particular assessment.

This component will have the following props:
    - `color`: A string representing the color of text that appears in the
        component. Any valid [css color](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)
        should be accepted as a valid string
    - `value`: This is the actual text to display. We'll learn later how to
        use the
        [children](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
        prop to make this component more pleasant to use, but this will do
        for now.

Using the component should look something like this:
```react
    <h1>Hello, <Text color="green" value="Kenzie" /></h1>
```

And produce a result that looks something like this:

![result of using component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenzieAcademy/hello-react/master/screenshots/result.png)

Keep in mind that the crucial bit is the `<Text ... />` part. The use of an
`<h1>` tag is _not_ relevant to this assessment.


### Step 3: Use your `Text` Component in the `App` Component
